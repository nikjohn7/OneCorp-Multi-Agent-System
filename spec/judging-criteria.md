# Participant Judging Guide

This guide helps you understand what judges are looking for in your multi-agent project. Use it to plan, build, and present your system effectively.

---

## 1. System Design & Architecture

**Judges look for:**

- A clear breakdown of your agents and their roles
- How agents communicate (messages, shared memory, tools, etc.)
- Stability and reliability of the overall system
- Thoughtful design choices, not just what works "by accident"

**Tip:** A diagram showing your agent interactions goes a long way.

---

## 2. Collaboration Between Agents

**Judges look for:**

- Actual multi-agent behavior (not just many functions in one agent)
- Good coordination strategies (planning, verification, delegation, etc.)
- Agents that meaningfully improve each other's outcomes

**Tip:** Show an example where agents exchange information meaningfully.

---

## 3. Creativity & Innovation

**Judges look for:**

- New ideas, architectures, or use cases
- Unique agent roles or emergent behaviors
- Smart use of tools, APIs, or external systems

**Tip:** Your idea doesn't need to be complex—just original and well-executed.

---

## 4. Task Performance

**Judges look for:**

- Does your system reliably accomplish the goal?
- Can it complete an end-to-end workflow?
- Does it solve the problem better with agents than with a single agent?

**Tip:** Show both success cases and how your system handles challenges.

---

## 5. Real-World Value

**Judges look for:**

- Clear problem/solution fit
- Potential for real users or real deployments
- Scalability or thoughtful constraints (cost, time, compute)

**Tip:** Even a prototype can shine if it has a real, compelling use case.

---

## 6. Safety & Reliability

**Judges look for:**

- Guardrails or validation steps
- Awareness of risks or failure modes
- Techniques to avoid runaway behavior or incorrect outputs

**Tip:** A simple verifier agent or a consistency check is often enough.

---

## 7. Presentation & User Experience

**Judges look for:**

- A clear explanation of how your system works
- Simple interfaces (CLI, UI, or well-structured logs)
- A polished demo that reflects what your agents can do

**Tip:** Focus on clarity—judges should understand your system in < 3 minutes.
